Day-1 : Class, Methods and Function:
==================================
Class:
- all the class name should starts with capital letters.


Methods:
- writing a function inside a class called method.
- all the methods name of the methods should be small.


decleration, defination and calling
- decleration and defenation should be out of the main class.
- calling should be inside  a class.


Function:

Syntax: (function)
	function_type function_name( parameter ){
		// decleration, defenation
	}

Function types: except void remaining types return the data. 



Day-2 : static block and constructor
====================================

Constructor:
- Constructor are used to initilize the oobject. For every class there will be default Constructor. Whenever e create an object Counstructor will be called.
- Constructor having class name and method properties.


Static Block:
- It is created with static Keyword.
- It will call automitacally.

example:
class Demo{
	static{
		System.out.print("Static Block");
	}
	Demo(){
		System.out.print("Constructor");
	}
}
public class q2{
	public static void main()(String args[]){
		Demo d1 = new Demo();
		Demo d2 = new Demo();
	}
}


Static Method:
- For static method no need to call with object, directly call with Class name, here static will act as instance.


Conditional Statements:
- if else, else if laddere, switch case
- these are used to check the condition and print that relevent block in constant time.


Control Statements:
Entry Control : for loop, while loop

Syntax (for loop) : for(starts; end; difference){}
       (while loop): start; while(end){ difference }

- when we know the range we use for loop, when we don't know the range we use while loop. 


Exit Control : do while loop

Jump Control : break, continue, return, throw, goto
