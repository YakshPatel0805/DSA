Day-1 : Class, Methods and Function:
==================================
Class:
- all the class name should starts with capital letters.


Methods:
- writing a function inside a class called method.
- all the methods name of the methods should be small.


decleration, defination and calling
- decleration and defenation should be out of the main class.
- calling should be inside  a class.


Function:

Syntax: (function)
	function_type function_name( parameter ){
		// decleration, defenation
	}

Function types: except void remaining types return the data. 



Day-2 : static block and constructor
====================================

Constructor:
- Constructor are used to initilize the oobject. For every class there will be default Constructor. Whenever e create an object Counstructor will be called.
- Constructor having class name and method properties.


Static Block:
- It is created with static Keyword.
- It will call automitacally.

example:
class Demo{
	static{
		System.out.print("Static Block");
	}
	Demo(){
		System.out.print("Constructor");
	}
}
public class q2{
	public static void main()(String args[]){
		Demo d1 = new Demo();
		Demo d2 = new Demo();
	}
}


Static Method:
- For static method no need to call with object, directly call with Class name, here static will act as instance.


Conditional Statements:
- if else, else if laddere, switch case
- these are used to check the condition and print that relevent block in constant time.


Control Statements:
Entry Control : for loop, while loop

Syntax (for loop) : for(starts; end; difference){  }
       (while loop): start; while(end){ difference }

- when we know the range we use for loop, when we don't know the range we use while loop. 


Exit Control : do while loop

Jump Control : break, continue, return, throw, goto


Day-4 : Switch Case Statements
==============================

- cases have to be same type as expressions, must be constant or litral.
- duplicates cases are not allowed.
- break is used to terminate the sequence.
- if break is not used, it will continue to next case.
- default will execute when none of above does.
- if default is not at the end, put break after it.

Syntax: 
switch(expression){
	case :
		Statements;
		break;
	default:
		Statements;
}

# Ternary Operator:
	( condition ) ? Statement1 : Statement2;
	(n == 1) ? print("Yes) : print("No")


For-Each loop:
- In, collection we don't have index value, in those situation we have to use for-each loop.
Syntax:
	for( var: arr ){
		Statements;
	}
